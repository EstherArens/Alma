# Alma
Possible place to run an Alma API from although I'm not sure I can do that from Github.

I have a list of Alma MMSIDs for which I'd like to retrieve their full MARC or MARCXML records using the GET/almaws/v1/bibs API (https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis/bibs/GET/gwPcGly021q2Z+qBbnVJzw==/af2fb69d-64f4-42bc-bb05-d8a0ae56936e).
